To create an interlinear gloss, use a fenced Div block (`:::`) with class "ex".

- Each line of the interlinear gloss should start with "|".
- Interlinear lines that start with "| -" are treated as preambles/original text (i.e. they are not aligned).
- The last interlinear line is treated as the free translation (single quotes are added automatically).

::: {.ex #ex-kl}
:::  gl
| - DaH mojaqmeyvam DIvuSnISbe’ ’e’ vIHar
| DaH mojaq-mey-vam DI-vuS-nIS-be’ ’e’ vI-Har
| now suffix-PL-DEM 1PL.A.3PL.P-limit-need-NEG that 1SG.A.3SG.P-believe
| I believe that we do not need to limit these suffixes now.

To create an example without free translation (and without the original text line):

::: {.ex #ex-sp}
::: gl
| el perrito está comiendo
| the {little dog} is eating
| -

Examples can also be simple paragraphs, with no interlinear glossing.
