## Numbered examples

To create a numbered example, use a fenced Div block (`:::`) with class `ex`. For example the following code results in Example (1).

::: ex
You do the job. You are not the job.
:::

## Subexamples

You can create subexamples within an `ex` Div block with a fenced Div block with class `exi` (for "example item") for each subexample.

::: ex
::: exi
A bird sings a beautiful song.
:::

::: exi
A fish swims in the pool.
:::
:::

## Interlinear glosses

To create an interlinear gloss, use a fenced Div block (`:::`) with class `gl` (usually, within an `ex` Div). These are the current rules:

-   Each line of the interlinear gloss should start with `|`.
-   Interlinear lines that start with `| -` are treated as preambles/original text (i.e. they are not aligned).
-   The last interlinear line is treated as the free translation.

:::: {#ex-lez .ex}
::: gl
| - Gila aburun ferma hamišaluǧ güǧüna amuq’dač.
| gila abur-u-n ferma hamišaluǧ güǧüna amuq’-da-č.
| now they-OBL-GEN farm forever behind stay-FUT-NEG
| 'Now their farm will not stay behind forever.'
:::
::::

## No free translation

To create a gloss without free translation, add a final empty line starting with `| -` (the following example is also without the original text line):

:::: {#ex-sp .ex}
::: gl
| el perrito está comiendo
| the {little dog} is eating
| -
:::
::::

## Mixing

You can include interlinear glosses in subexamples and mix glosses with simple sentences. Note that more than three colons `:` can be used for fenced Div blocks to show the different levels of embedding within the `ex` Div (this is entirely optional).

::::: ex
::: exi
Abandon all hope, ye who enter.
:::

::: exi
The Self, smaller than small, greater than great, is hidden in the heart of every creature.
:::

:::: exi
::: gl
| n=an apedani mehuni essandu
| CONN=him that.DAT.SG time.DAT.SG eat.they.shall
| 'They shall celebrate him on that date.'
